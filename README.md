The **Open Reaction Database (ORD)** is an open-source database for chemical synthesis reactions, collecting a variety of conditions and records required for different chemical syntheses, which can be used for machine learning or deep learning. ORD provides a user-friendly online interactive interface (https://open-reaction-database.org/client/browse). However, for beginners, what they need is a simple *download button* to get the data in `.csv` format, which is not obviously available on this page. The `Granda_Perera_ml_example.ipynb` in ORD's Github page provides the corresponding operation for the above requirement. This project extracts the corresponding code from this `Granda_Perera_ml_example.ipynb`, allowing users to easily download the required ORD data through the powerful UI interactive interface of *Streamlit*ðŸŽˆ.
